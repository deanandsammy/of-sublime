## getting started

- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - if you haven't even installed sublime text3 yet, download it here
- [key bindings](https://github.com/elegantspirit/of-sublime/blob/master/assets/key-bindings.md) - the keymap of sublime text3 is the same scheme as webstorm, update the key bindings of sublime text3 with this scheme, you could input code with great efficiency

## UI theme

- [Boxy theme]() - my favorite UI theme of sublime text, It has plenty of options that enable you to personalize your experience with Boxy theme
